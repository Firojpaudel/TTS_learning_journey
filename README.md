# TTS_learning_journey

Welcome! This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey in mastering Text-to-Speech (TTS) technologies from the ground up.

## 📚 Purpose
We are currently in the R&D phase of TTS models, and I want to master the fundamentals and advanced techniques of TTS. This repo will serve as my personal log, experiment tracker, and knowledge base.

## 🗺️ Roadmap
1. **XTTS**: Start with XTTS to understand the basics and get hands-on with normal speech synthesis, voice cloning, multi-speaker training, and finetuning.
2. **VITS**: Dive into VITS to explore more advanced and modern TTS architectures, including neural vocoders and end-to-end pipelines.
3. **Other Models**: Explore additional TTS models and techniques as I discover them (suggestions welcome!).
4. **Tortoise**: Finally, study Tortoise for high-quality, expressive TTS generation and advanced emotional synthesis.

## 🚦 Progress
| Model         | Status      |
|-------------- |:----------:|
| 🟢 XTTS       | In Progress |
| ⚪ VITS        | Unexplored  |
| ⚪ Other Models| Unexplored  |
| ⚪ Tortoise    | Unexplored  |

<!-- Update the status as you progress: 🟢 In Progress, 🟡 Reviewing, 🟣 Completed, ⚪ Unexplored -->

## 🎯 End Goal
By the end of this journey, I aim to:
- Gain a deep understanding of TTS models and their training pipelines
- Build and finetune my own TTS models
- Experiment with emotional TTS synthesis (creating models that can express emotions in speech)

## 📝 How I'll Use This Repo
- Document learnings, code snippets, and experiments for each model
- Track progress and ideas in the respective subfolders (XTTS, VITS, Tortoise, etc.)
- Share insights, challenges, and breakthroughs
